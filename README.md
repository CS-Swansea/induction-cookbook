Swansea Computer Science Postgrad/RA induction cookbook
=======================================================

You are a new postgrad or RA in Swansea University’s Computer Science department. You are excited and possibly disoriented. How do you find your way around? Where can you find your mail? Where are the coffee machines? How can you find out about printing, photocopying or scanning documents? How about getting card access to rooms in the department? Fret not young researcher! Your ancestors have put together this cookbook to keep you from feeling out of your depth and let you focus on doing research. Good luck!

#### I’m a new postgraduate student. How do I enrol?
>If you’ve started in September/October you should be able to enrol [online](https://intranet.swansea.ac.uk). If you started in one of the other enrolment periods (January, April, July) you’ll need to visit the Academic Registry and fill out a form (see key buildings, below). If you’re an international student, you’ll also need to fill in an attendance monitoring form (available from Faraday Tower Room 313) every month.

#### How do I get a staff/student card?
>Once you have a student number or employment contract, you can get your card printed from the Information Desk in the Bay Library (Bay) or the Library and Information Centre (Singleton). While the card is being printed, make sure to ask for your new account details so that you can log in to university services.

#### How do I access email, intranet, files and other services?
>Most university services can be accessed via [home.swan.ac.uk](https://home.swan.ac.uk). You will also find College of Science specific services on the [college intranet](https://science.swansea.ac.uk/) (e.g., submitting studies for ethical review, booking annual leave).

#### What about internet access?
>When you first arrive, you can connect to the SwanseaUni-Visitors WiFi network to get online while you are settling in. Once you have a university account, you will be able to connect to Eduroam, which provides you with WiFi access at Swansea University and at many other educational institutions worldwide. To get connected, you first need to register your device: whilst on campus, join the SwanseaUni-Setup WiFi network and follow the [instructions](http://swanseauni-wifi.swansea.ac.uk/). Once registered, you can delete the SwanseaUni-Setup network and connect to Eduroam using your university account, making sure to include the @swansea.ac.uk part of your username.

#### Where is my desk? How do I get a computer?
>Ask your supervisor/line manager about where you’ll be sitting, and how to get a computer or laptop.

#### I neeeeeed caffeine! Where are the kitchens?
>There are kitchens / tea points on every floor of both the East and West sides of the Computational Foundry. There is also a larger social space, the Crucible, on the first floor (East).

#### Where are all the other postgrads?
>The postgraduate spaces in the Computational Foundry are on the East side of the building, in the large glass-fronted rooms overlooking the Crucible.

#### Where can I find snail mail addressed to me?
>Go to the first room on your right on the West side of the Computational Foundry, and look in the pigeon hole labelled “Postgrads and RAs”.

#### Where do I go to book travel for a conference?
>Submit a request via [ABW](https://abw.swansea.ac.uk/BusinessWorld/Login/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fBusinessWorld) (or ask your supervisor to do this for you). At the same time, make sure you complete the travel forms to ensure you are covered by the university’s travel insurance - ask Katie in Computational Foundry room 015 for details.

#### Great - I’m going on a trip! How do I claim back my expenses?
>Staff members should use the [expenses claim system](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/FinanceForms/Default.aspx). Postgrads need to use a paper-based system - see [forms and documents](https://cs.swan.ac.uk/~cssimonr/resources/).

#### Where do I order new equipment for my research?
>Submit a request via [ABW](https://abw.swansea.ac.uk/BusinessWorld/Login/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fBusinessWorld) (or ask your supervisor to do this for you). Your equipment will then be delivered to Engineering Stores.

#### What about basic equipment, such as paper, stationery or batteries?
>Pop down to Computational Foundry room 015 and ask Katie. For yearly items (i.e., diaries, calendars, wall planners), keep an eye out for Julie's annual email to place your request.

#### How do I get ethical approval for studies?
>Complete the ethical review form on the [science intranet](https://science.swansea.ac.uk/intranet/safety/ethics). (For students, your supervisor will need to approve the application first.)

#### Where do I get card access to different rooms/buildings in the department or university?
>For university wide access, email [cardaccess](mailto:cardaccess@swansea.ac.uk). For rooms in the department, you will need to go to Computational Foundry room 105 and speak to Julie. In general, you will be able to get access to most public spaces in the department, (e.g., Crucible, lab spaces). Bear in mind that access to certain rooms (such as the some lab spaces) requires specific training, or approval from your supervisor or the Head of Department.

#### Where can I find printer settings? How do I connect to the VPN?
>There are photocopier/scanner/printer machines in room 015 and the pigeon hole room on the third floor, each of which you will be able to connect to whilst on the university’s network. Insturctions to connect to these printers from your personal machine can be seen [here](https://science.swansea.ac.uk/info/pages/print.php). If you have any problems with these printers, the College of Science [technicians](mailto:cosit@swansea.ac.uk) will be able to help. Once set up, you can scan your staff/student card at any photocopier to retrieve your items, and check your account status at the [printer page](https://printing.swansea.ac.uk/).

#### How do I get this ‘CS’ web and email account everyone is raving about? And why should I care?
>You can request your account from the College of Science [technicians](mailto:cosit@swansea.ac.uk). Email from your Swansea University address, and let them know that you’re a new postgraduate student or RA, and would like an account on the Computer Science server. This account gives you access to the department’s computing facilities and web hosting, plus any other services you might want the technicians to set up for you.

#### How do I get on mailing lists?
>There are several email lists used for communication within the CS department (see the [overview](http://cs.swansea.ac.uk/lists/)). In general, PhD students should be subscribed to [cs-postgrads](http://cos.swansea.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/cs-postgrads) and RAs should be subscribed to [cs-research-staff](http://cos.swansea.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/cs-research-staff). Follow these links to request to be added to the lists.

#### How can I access/edit my personal website?
>You can access your personal web space using any FTP client (e.g., Cyberduck). The server address is cs-svr1.swan.ac.uk on port 22 (SFTP/SSH). Connect using your CS account credentials.

#### How do I get a license for software X?
>Drop the College of Science technicians an [email](mailto:cosit@swansea.ac.uk). The department also has academic licenses for a variety of Microsoft software through MSDN academic alliance. If you have not got an account for this, request one from the technicians. In addition, the university holds licenses for a range of software packages - enquire in the Library and Information Centre to find out more.

#### Any other problems?
>If you have any technical questions or problems, send an email to [cosit](cosit@swansea.ac.uk). For other types of problems, speak to your supervisor or line manager. If you have a problem with your supervisor or line manager, speak to the Head of Department. For other problems, contact [Student Support Services](student.support@swansea.ac.uk) or [Occupational Health](occupational-health@swansea.ac.uk).
